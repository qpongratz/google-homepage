This project will be a recreation of the google homepage in appearance.

Learned how to more properly use the div tag. Coming in I knew they were important, but I didn't quite grasp what one actually did with them. I think this is probably my biggest breakthrough of this project. Just understanding how much a building block those things are.

Learned how to not only investigate other websites with the dev tools, but my own to find problem bits of code or styling that aren't quite functioning how I intend.

Learned overall just different tricks to position elements on a webpage and became more comfortable with using some of them like position: relative and display: inline and the span tag.
